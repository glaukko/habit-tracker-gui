### habit-tracker-gui

Simple Desktop App that provides an interface with checkboxes for the user to check the days where they completed a given, specific task, identified by its .hbt file name.

![Main app window. Days 27-31 are disabled because they are in the future](https://i.imgur.com/nDqQ3ED.png)

## Features

<b> Loading and saving files </b> - the program can save the data on a custom .hbt file and load it later (it automatically loads the last saved file on start)

<b> Streak counting </b> - shows current streak if multiple days in a row have been checked and also shows the maximum streak ever done

<b> Statistics </b> - see additional info about the current file data 

# Dependencies

Uses Tkinter for GUI. This is my first project with Tkinter
